# Turtle-Graphics

Recursive descent parser for a drawing language written in C. Using instructions like "go forward" and "turn left 90" you can draw stuff to screen using SDL.

Also contains a hashed password system and a whitespace (!) interpreter.

Whitespace ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language) ) is a parody language where all of the characters are whitespace (tabs, spaces etc.) and characters are comments. The program can convert your written code to Whitespace and run it, as well as combining two different programs, one as whitespace, one as regular, and running each one after another.
