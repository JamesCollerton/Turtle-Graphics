/*

These are the unit test versions of my code compiled with CUnit. CUnit isn't on the lab
computers so these won't compile here. However please have a look at the code and the outputted
.txt files to see what was tested!

Rather than comment everything again, I only commented the new unit tests. Because of all the
print statements they should all be fairly self documenting and so comments tend to be quite
minimal.
